Build instructions:
First, the chassis has to be assembled, and we start with the upper chasssis, where the linear bearings are inserted in its holders, that are then inserted in the upper chassis sections.

The screen release switch is mounted, the pin is made by cutting a screw or threaded rod.

A spring must be sourced from a ballpen and inserted into the screen release switch

Completed upper frame

Bottom chasssis halves must be welded togheter with a soldering iron. You can add material while soldering by melting a piece of filaent into the crack between the parts to be soldered.
ventilation frames and mounting points for rails is inserted into the lowered chassis.

The lower rails is carriying power and usb signals must be wired up. The Three EXT plugs should have one USB cablewired to each one, so they can be plugged in to the rasberry pi.the power plug should have the DC power + and - connected to one pair of wires, the othe pair of wire should then be connected as a power on button on the power module, going to the rasberry pi.after verifying correct soldering, hot glue can be applied onto the solder points.



The rails can then be assembled to bottom chassis.

Feed the wires through the cutouts in the chassis:

Tthen upper and lower chassis are stacked and screwed down.

Side rails are assembled

Then screen assembly begins. the base must be welded together with soldering iron, and placed over chassis. Then guiderods are installed, locking the base down.

The completed base with sliding mechanism lets us continue assembly to screen:
